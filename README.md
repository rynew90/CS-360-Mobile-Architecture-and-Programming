Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?

```This app was designed to fulfill the needs of a warehouse or store organize and maintain inventory. Users would use this app to check inventory stock and reorder stock when it becomes low. Further goals of this app would be to alert warehouse or store staff when stock is low to inform them of needed reordering of stock.```
    
What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?

```This app required that a login screen be created so that users could log into the app to make use of its functionality. It also required that a screen be created to allow new users to create an account if they do not already have one for the app. The last necessary screen that was made for this app is the screen that displays the list of inventory items that is held in a database allowing users to view and change the amount and items in the inventory.```
    
How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?

```To develop this app I first created the screens by drawing them out to get an idea of how the app would be laid out to better decide how to meet user needs. Then I designed the code and xml files to make sure that the screens worked well to meet the needs of users and functioned in a way that is easy for users to understand and adapt to. Finally, I began to implement the code, testing as I created the code, to match the desired functionality to ensure that users would be able to use the app to perform all of their needs.```
   
How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?

```In testing the code for this app, I made sure to test the code as I was developing the app to ensure that the code worked as intended and that no new code had inadverse effects on the code that had already been created and tested. This helped to ensure that any issues that arose in the code was found swiftly and was fixed immediately, reducing the amount of time and energy needed to fix buggy code that made it into later stages of the coding process.```
    
Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?

```The largest area where I had to innovate to overcome challenges was in the implmentation of the database into the code to allow the user to view and change the data that was in the database. Coding the database proved to be a bit difficult as the reading in the course material showed a way of developing code for the database that did not seem to work with the app. Therefore, I had to learn a different way that would work with the app and not cause the app to crash when creating and loading in the database.```
    
In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?

```I feel that I have become rather skilled at creating the interfaces and screens for the app that work with the code and creates an appealing and easy to understand visual representation of the data and workflow of the app that users will be interacting with when using the app.```
